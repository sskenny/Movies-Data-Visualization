# Movies-Data-Visualization
## Summary 
I analyzed a data set of movies from 1884 - 2018. I removed movies from below 1990 since most movies in the dataset were produced from the 1990s onwards.   number of flights, time of day, month of year and airport. We were unable to perform further analysis on the reasons for delay because there were many missing values for the flight delay reason columns.
